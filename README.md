# ThreeTSTemplate
A quick starter template for running ThreeJS with Typescript and an Http server (Node).

This will get you started on your Typescript + ThreeJS project. I've used Webpack for bundling. 
Modify/Extend boilerplate/boilerplate.ts to extend the application. You can use initHook and animateHook to plugin your code.

index.ts - Loads the boilerplate code. Modify it to start your class instead.

# Instructions
run 'npm install' on your terminal in the package.json to install the package dependencies

run 'npm run start' to build and start a server on localhost:8080. Go to 'localhost' from your browser to access the application.

run 'npm run build' or 'npx webpack'  in another terminal to build the application while the server is running

run 'npm run rebuild' to clean build

All the scripts can be found in package.json. Modify them to suit your own needs.

I followed Webpack's documentation to build this.
